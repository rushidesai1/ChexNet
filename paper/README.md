Your draft should be in a form of regular research publication.

It means all sections which are common in research publication such as Abstract, Introduction, Approach/Metrics, Experimental Results, Discussion, and Conclusion must be there. You don't have to use exactly the same section names or order described above, but you should have those 'contents' somewhere in your paper.

You should organize well and write clearly each section so that it is easily readable.

A few additional comments are:

* Describe your method/approach clearly, concisely, but specifically. It should be at the level of that any reader can follow and reproduce your work after she read your paper.
* Even if your current results are not good as expected, there must be analyses about what possible reasons and solutions/plans are. It is same for when your results are good also.
* Here the 'results', especially for the draft, can be any results. For example, results by yet simpler model which can be used as one of baseline in your final paper, results from intermediate steps prior to your ultimate target task, results with a tiny subset of your dataset generated for a verification of your pipeline, etc., all those followed by your own analysis can be used.
* Grading of both your draft and final paper is not based on some 'numbers' from metrics. Instead, it will be on how comprehensive your project/paper is; how well the problem and the task are defined; whether your approach including feature extraction/processing and modeling are reasonable and convincing; how well you described these things, etc.
* Also, your proposal, draft, and final paper are independent to each other, which means we will not check whether you keep everything what you said you want to do, so you can switch/deviate from your proposal and even from draft anytime if you want to, so please plan early and make sure you are on the right track.
